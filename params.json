As such, this fork includes tweaks to allow docparser.js to parse a VBScript comment. It is recommended that each line of the code comment begin with two apostrophes. One to create a comment and a second to close the string literal when viewing source from within YUIDoc. \r\n\r\n###Example VBScript code comment\r\n```\r\n''/**\r\n'' * This is an example function\r\n'' * @method testForAwesome\r\n'' * @param testValue {string} a value to test\r\n'' * @return `true` when awesome is in abundance\r\n'' */\r\nFunction testForAwesome(testValue)\r\n    ' detect awesome\r\nEnd Function\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
